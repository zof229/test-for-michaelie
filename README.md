Hi michaelie!!! this is public, so you and anyone else can see it.


There are things that i can do to limit stuff. For example, I can set a *temporary* interaction limit to certain chategories of users, e.g."Users that are not collaborators will not be able to interact with the repository.", for up to 6 months.

You can also limit who can approve or request changes "Restrict users who are permitted to approve or request changes on pull requests in this repository."

you can also change a bunch of stuff around branch permissions and that sort of stuff, but yeah, can explain xxx
